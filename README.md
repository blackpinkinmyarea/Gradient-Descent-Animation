- Title: Create Animation To Demonstrate Gradient Descent Algorithm In 2-Dimensional Space.
- Objective:
  + This project aims to develop a Python implementation of the gradient descent optimization algorithm, which helps you deeply understand matrices and vectors.
  + It serves as a practical exercise to enhance proficiency in Python programming and deepen understanding of gradient descent's mechanics in the context of machine learning optimization.
- Tools Used:
  + Python for coding and simulation.
  + Libraries such as Sklearn, Numpy, and Mathplotlib.
- Tasks:
  + Create needed functions using math formulas to handle matrices.
  + Create randomly 2 lists (A, b) of the same length then transpose them.
  + Use a chart to show the correlation of the two lists above.
  + Use the linear regression formula to draw a line (parabole) so that the line (parabole) is close to the points plotted in the above step.
  + Create a list containing all 1, the same length as list A, and add to list A by column.
  + (For gradient descent for parabole, we need to create a list A^2 and then add it to the matrix that contains vector A and vector 1).
  + Random initial line (parabole).
  + Run gradient descent algorithm to adjust initial line (parabole) so that initial line (parabole) gets closer to the line (parabole) that we use algorithm linear regression to draw.
  + Draw all lines (paraboles) that the gradient descent algorithm creates.
  + Create an animation that represents the initial line (parabole) gradually descending to the line (parabole) that a linear regression algorithm created.
- Knowledge Utilized:
  + Proficiency in Python programming, including familiarity with syntax, data structures, and control flow.
  + Understanding of optimization algorithms, particularly gradient descent, and its iterative process of updating parameters to minimize a cost function.
  + Fundamental knowledge of calculus and linear algebra, particularly derivatives, and vector operations.
- Project Description:
  + This project involves simulating the gradient descent optimization algorithm using Python in a 2-dimensional space.
  + Gradient descent is a fundamental optimization algorithm used in machine learning for minimizing the loss function during training.
  + By visualizing the optimization process, users can gain insights into how gradient descent works and understand its behavior in different scenarios.
- Working Principle:
  + Initialize the parameter (point) randomly.
  + Create initial line (parabole).
  + Create line (parabole) using linear regression algorithm.
  + Create an animation that represents the initial line (parabole) gradually descending to the line (parabole) that a linear regression algorithm created.
